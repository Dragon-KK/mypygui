    <!-- I think svg support can like be an extension of the language -->
    <!-- Allow for additional 'py componenets' -->
    <!-- So things like canvases, svgs etc. can be py components -->
    <!-- Py componenets are forced to be on a new layer (a new composite will be created for it. * The composite need not be a tkinter canvas) -->
    <!-- py components can be used for things that exist in standard html but are implemented differently over here -->
    <!-- For example svg is going to be implemeneted using 'shapes' and canvas will be implemented using the tkinter canvas etc. -->

    <!-- # TODO:aspect ratio -->
    <!-- Aspect ratio will just take the elements width and make it the height thats it (before layouting children) -->
